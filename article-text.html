    <h1>A Brief History of HTML</h1>
    <p>
      The history of hypertext markup language is a strange and interesting
      tale. From its simple start as an online subset of SGML through political
      maneuverings of the huge browser companies to its current piecemeal – but
      growing – compatibility, the language has weathered a storm of growth,
      abuse, and innovation.

        Recently, the battle for control of the standard has focused on
        functionality. Microsoft and Netscape are both touting W3C compliance as
        a crucial marketing advantage. And the work being done on the latest
        HTML draft shows there may be light at the end of the tunnel. But it
        wasn't always this rosy.

          The idea behind HTML was a modest one. When Tim Berners-Lee was
          putting together his first elementary browsing and authoring system
          for the Web, he created a quick little hypertext language that would
          serve his purposes. He imagined dozens, or even hundreds, of hypertext
          formats in the future, and smart clients that could easily negotiate
          and translate documents from servers across the Net. It would be a
          system similar to Claris XTND on the Macintosh, but would work on any
          platform and browser. The problem, however, turned out to be in the
          simplicity of Berners-Lee's language. Since it was text-based, you
          could use any editor or word processor to create or convert documents
          for the Web. And there was just a handful of tags – anyone could
          master HTML in an afternoon. The Web flourished. Everyone started
          publishing. The rest is history.

            But as more and more content moved to the Web, those creating
            browsers realized the simple markup language needed much
            improvement. How should the innovation take place? Tim Berners-Lee
            certainly wasn't going to be the sole developer of HTML – he never
            intended to be. So the developers, in the long-held tradition of the
            Internet, implemented new features in their browsers and then
            shipped them. If the Web community liked them, they stayed. If not,
            they were removed.
